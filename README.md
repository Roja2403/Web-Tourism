    It gives a description about the place with timing and location details of that particular place.
    If they select their destinations in the hotels tab,hotels in that destination will be displayed with the booking form.
    
  **HOTEL RECOMMENDATION MODULE:**
    Content-based filtering is the method that solves this problem. Our system first uses the metadata of new hotels when creating recommendations, while visitor action is secondary for a certain period of time. And our systems recommend a product to a user based upon the category and description of the hotel.
      We would like to recommend hotels based on the hotels that a user has already booked or viewed using the cosine similarity. We would recommend hotels with the largest similarity to the ones previously booked or viewed or showed interest by the user. Our recommender system is highly dependent on defining an appropriate similarity measure. Eventually, we select a subset of hotels to display to the user or to determine an order in which to display the hotels.
      
      
  **LANGUAGE TRANSLATOR MODULE**:
    Googletrans is a free and unlimited python library that implemented Google Translate API.We can actually do a lot of things with the help of the Google Translate API ranging from detecting languages to simple text translation, setting source and destination languages, and translating entire lists of text phrases. The user has to enter the text to be translated in the input field and it gets translated to the desired language.
